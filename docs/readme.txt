Since: July 04/04/2011
Author: Stephane Boulard <lossendae@gmail.com>
License: GNU GPLv2 (or later at your option)

REQUIREMENT
-----------

- MODx Revolution 2.0.8


NOTES
-----

If you're not activating the theme via the installer, don't forget to change the default theme to "soft" 
(Search for "theme" in the setting table) and disable CSS and JS compression (Search for "compress" in the setting table) 
if you want to use the soft theme.

If you're using a Manager language other than english or french, you'll have to edit the CSS file
located in manager/temmplates/soft/css/index.css to add the top menu ids for the menu bar icons.

You'll also have to add an additional CSS property if you want your topmenu to have an icon as well.
